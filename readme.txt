Sentence Analysis Algorithm

Overview
This project involves writing an algorithm to analyze a sentence that ends with a period. The algorithm will determine the length of the sentence, the number of words, and the number of vowels. Each character in the sentence will be treated separately, and the last character will always be a period.

Requirements
    A programming environment to write and execute your code.
    Basic understanding of loops and conditional statements.

Instructions
    01. Calculate The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
    02. Calculate The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
    03. Calculate The number of vowels in the sentence.

Keep in mind
        - Each character will be treated separately.
        - The last character is the point.
        - Use three variables as counters.
